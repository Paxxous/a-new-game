# Hello

I'm gonna revamp that one C++ game, I'm coding it on windows this time, since I had a hard time shipping the last game to other machines, (most of them run on windows.)

## Compiling the game

First copy the source through git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Paxxous/a-new-game.git
```

Then, compile the code via the makefile:

```sh
make
```
